//  * Challenge: build the basic structure of our game
//  * 
//  * 1. <h1> title at the top
//  * 2. <textarea> for the box to type in 
//  *      (tip: React normalizes <textarea /> to be more like <input />, 
//  *      so it can be used as a self-closing element and uses the `value` property
//  *      to set its contents)
//  * 3. <h4> ti display the amount of time remaining
//  * 4. <button> to start the game
//  * 5. Another <h1> to display the word count
//  *

/**
 * Challenge: Using hooks, track the state of the text in the textarea on every keystroke
 * To verify it's working, you could just console.log the state on every change
